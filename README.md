# Homey-Luxtronik
This repository provides the source code for the Luxtronik app available to Homey users. The Wiki and Issue tracker for this project are also to be found here.

This app lets you add heatpumps to Homey from the following manufacturers:
- Alpha Innotec
- Siemens Novelan
- Roth
- Elco
- Buderus
- Nibe
- Wolf Heiztechnik

Neither of these manufacturers are connected to this project. Some images used in this project are owned by Alpha Innotec.

## About
This app is mostly based off of previous work like [Bouni/luxtronik](https://github.com/Bouni/luxtronik), [Bouni/python-luxtronik](https://github.com/Bouni/python-luxtronik) and [BenPru/Luxtronik](https://github.com/BenPru/luxtronik).

The app only support Luxtronik 2 / 2.1 controllers currently, but YMMV.
