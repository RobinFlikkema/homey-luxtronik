# Homey-Luxtronik
This repository provides the source code for the Luxtronik app available to Homey users. The Wiki and Issue tracker for this project are also to be found here.

This app lets you add heatpumps to Homey from the following manufacturers:
- Alpha Innotec
- Siemens Novelan
- Roth
- Elco
- Buderus
- Nibe
- Wolf Heiztechnik

Neither of these manufacturers are connected to this project. Some images used in this project are owned by Alpha Innotec.

## About
This app is mostly based off of previous work like [Bouni/luxtronik](https://github.com/Bouni/luxtronik), [Bouni/python-luxtronik](https://github.com/Bouni/python-luxtronik) and [BenPru/Luxtronik](https://github.com/BenPru/luxtronik).

The app only support Luxtronik 2 / 2.1 controllers currently, but YMMV.
The following functionality is currently supported:
| **Values**                    | **Getable** | **Settable** | **Comment**                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Total used Energy**         | Yes         |              |                                              |
| **Energy used for heating**   | Yes         |              |                                              |
| **Energy used for Water**     | Yes         |              |                                              |

| **Outdoor Temperature**       | Yes         |              | This, obviously, requires an outdoor sensor  |
| **Room Temperature Current**  | Yes         |              | This currently required the RBE room display |
| **Room Temperature Set**      | Yes         |              | This currently required the RBE room display |
| **Water Temperature Current** | Yes         |              |                                              |
| **Water Temperature Set**     | Yes         |              |                                              |
| **Source Temperature In**     | Yes         |              |                                              |

| **System Temperature Suppy**  | Yes         |              |                                              |
| **System Temperature Return** | Yes         |              |                                              |
